## Introduction
The House Prices dataset aims to predict the final sale price of homes based on various features. This project focuses on performing EDA to uncover patterns, relationships, and distributions within the data.
## Dataset Description
The dataset includes 80 explanatory variables describing various aspects of residential homes in Ames, Iowa. The target variable is SalePrice, the property's sale price in dollars.
## Exploratory Data Analysis
In this section, we examine the dataset to understand its structure, missing values, and basic statistics. Key steps include:
- Loading the dataset.
- Summarizing data types and basic statistics.
- Visualizing missing values.
- Identifying and handling outliers.
## Correlation Analysis
We compute the correlation matrix to understand the relationships between numerical variables. Key findings include:
Strong positive correlation between SalePrice and GrLivArea, GarageCars, and TotalBsmtSF.
Moderate positive correlations with variables such as 1stFlrSF, FullBath, and YearBuilt.
## Distribution Analysis
We analyze the distribution of the target variable SalePrice and key explanatory variables. Key steps include:
Plotting histograms and density plots.
